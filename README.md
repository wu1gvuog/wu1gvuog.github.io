The goal of this project is to liberate Europeans from the technofeudalism imposed by American corporations and the American government.

This project also aims to guide individuals on navigating their careers successfully without supporting
adversarial entities, such as American corporations contributing to human rights violations.

We advocate for big-tech corporations to be held accountable for any harm their actions may cause. It is important to note that attributing blame to an entire organization can dilute responsibility. Often, a small group of decision-makers within the management is responsible for questionable choices.

Employees working on beneficial projects, such as developing open-source tools or contributing to scientific advancements, should not be judged based on the broader actions of their employer. However, supporting or endorsing controversial corporate decisions can have a negative impact. Our aim is to delineate the distinction between these roles clearly.

Not every American product you use, or even pay for, even if its creator is malicious, leads to their gain.
Watching high-quality videos on YouTube probably is not beneficial for Google on their own, because
YouTube actually loses a lot of money on it. But you let them make you stupid by watching reels, which weakens
you and makes it easier for them to control you

A well-nourished European is a strong European, so we will also publish information on proper nutrition and recipes celebrating the culinary heritage of our continent.
